# Heart Rates App

This was my final project for Computer Science II, a heart rate app in Java using JavaFX and SceneBuilder that takes a user's birthday and returns their age, their maximum heart rate, and their target heart rate range. UI was built in SceneBuilder, and the backend work in Java using IntelliJ and Sublime.
